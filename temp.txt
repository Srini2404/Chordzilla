import bluetooth
Use the discover_devices() function to get a list of nearby Bluetooth devices:
makefile
Copy code
devices = bluetooth.discover_devices()
Loop through the list of devices and check if the device you want to connect to is in the list. You can use the lookup_name() function to get the name of each device:
kotlin
Copy code
for device in devices:
    name = bluetooth.lookup_name(device)
    if name == 'DEVICE_NAME':
        target_address = device
        break
Replace 'DEVICE_NAME' with the name of the device you want to connect to.

Use the BluetoothSocket class to create a Bluetooth socket and connect to the device:
scss
Copy code
sock = bluetooth.BluetoothSocket(bluetooth.RFCOMM)
sock.connect((target_address, 1))
The second argument to connect() is the channel number. If you don't know the channel number, you can use the get_service_records() function to get a list of services provided by the device and their channel numbers:

css
Copy code
services = bluetooth.find_service(address=target_address)
Once you have connected to the device, you can send and receive data using the socket's send() and recv() methods:
kotlin
Copy code
sock.send('Hello, world!')
data = sock.recv(1024)
Replace 'Hello, world!' with the data you want to send. The argument to recv() is the maximum number of bytes to receive.

When you are done with the connection, close the socket:
go
Copy code
sock.close()
